# cyChart 

This is a graphical interface to the filter mechanism found in Cytoscape's Select tab.

Right click on a numerical column and select Histogram Filter...

A plot will appear.  Drag within the plot area to create an H shaped selection field.  Drag either end or the middle to edit the field.  

(Editing is flaky if left edge is at the Y axis.  Drag in center to move selection off the axis.)
